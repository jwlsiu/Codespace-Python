# Python Basics - Activity 1
# Write a Python program to print the result of the following operations.
# Declare operations as variables a, b, c, d
a = -5 + 8 * 6
b = (55 + 9) % 9
c = 20 + -3 * 5 / 8
d = 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3
# Print variables to show result
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)

# Python Basics - Activity 2
# Write a Python program to divide two numbers, using the input from the user, and print the result on the screen.
# Declare two integer variables from user input
first_number = int(input("Input the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Input the second number: "))
# Declare 'divide' variable as first number divided by the second number and print answer
divide = int(first_number / second_number)
print(f"The division of the first number and the second number is: {divide}")
